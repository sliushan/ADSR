# ADSR
A Distributed Security and Robust Power Management Framework for More Electric Aircraft  

**FI&R**: Fault isolation and reconfiguration part.  
**Power_scheduling**: Rolling scheduling part.  
**YALMIP-master**: YALMIP file (a MATLAB toolbox for optimization modeling).  
  
**Note 1**: Since the syntax of software packages may be updated, we have uploaded the YALMIP file used in the experiment to ensure that the code can be run smoothly.  
  
**Note 2**: If you use our code, please cite the following:
